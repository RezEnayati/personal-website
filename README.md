This is the source code for my personal website:  
 **[https://rezaenayati.co](https://rezaenayati.co)**

It highlights my work in AI/ML, iOS development, and other areas I'm passionate about. The site includes:

- A live chatbot (**RezAi**) fine-tuned on my own interview responses  
- A showcase of selected projects (AI, Swift, NLP, etc.)  
- My resume and contact information  
- Favorite books, research papers, and even a playlist

The site is fully custom-built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed via GitHub Pages.
