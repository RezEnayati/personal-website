# Hello World

This is the first post on my blog. I've been meaning to start writing for a while — not just about code, but about the ideas behind the code.

## Why a blog?

Most of what I learn happens in between the lines: debugging a subtle race condition at 2 AM, realizing that a "simple" feature touches six systems, or finding an elegant solution buried in a paper from 2017. Those moments rarely make it into a README.

A blog is a place for that kind of thinking.

## What I'll write about

Mostly **AI/ML engineering** — fine-tuning, embeddings, retrieval systems, and the infrastructure that holds it all together. But also:

- Building products that feel good to use
- The gap between research papers and production code
- Tools and workflows that actually help

## How this site is built

This portfolio runs on **React 19** + **Vite** + **Tailwind v4**, deployed on Vercel. The blog uses MDX compiled at build time with `rehype-pretty-code` for syntax highlighting.

Here's a quick example:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B",
    device_map="auto",
)
```

Simple stack, fast builds, no CMS. Just markdown files in a `content/` folder.

More soon.
